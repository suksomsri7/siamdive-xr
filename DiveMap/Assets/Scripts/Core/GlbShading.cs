    /// Why a KTX2 glTF model renders with black patches on this project, expressed as arithmetic
    /// so it is asserted by a test instead of described in a comment.
    ///
    /// 🔴 THE BUG, measured. The QC model pass photographs six CDN models through the app's own
    /// loader. <c>cc0_kraken_xr0</c> came back <c>blackOfSubject=10.04%</c> and
    /// <c>stat_verdant_poseidon_xr0</c> <c>12.46%</c> — hard-edged black polygons all over both.
    /// Everything the GLB itself could be blamed for was measured on the file and cleared:
    ///
    ///   • geometry — 0 NaN normals, 0 zero-length tangents, tangent w is exactly ±1, 0 tangents
    ///     parallel to their normal, 0 degenerate triangles (68,226 verts / 41,794 tris);
    ///   • metal — <c>metallicFactor</c> defaults to 1 but the metallic-roughness map's BLUE
    ///     channel averages 0.001, so the surface is a dielectric and the reflection-cube story
    ///     that <see cref="P:UnityEngine.RenderSettings.customReflectionTexture"/> exists for does
    ///     not apply here;
    ///   • base colour — the atlas is 24% pure-black gutter, but rasterising the real UVs at the
    ///     QC camera's real framing, sampling the KTX2's own 12-level mip chain trilinearly, put
    ///     0.00% of the model's screen area on a black texel (the wreck, which does NOT go black
    ///     in the app, scores worst at 0.10% — the wrong way round);
    ///   • back faces — 0.04% of the model's pixels show one, and glTFast's built-in-RP shader
    ///     flips the normal for them anyway (<c>fragBaseFacing</c>, VFACE).
    ///
    /// What is left is the NORMAL MAP, and the number that convicts it is the shading curve. Bin
    /// the model's pixels by how much light the MESH normal should catch and compare the app's
    /// own screenshot with an offline render of the same GLB at the same camera:
    ///
    ///   geometric N·L bin        0.00   0.15   0.30   0.45   0.60   0.75
    ///   app (Unity build)         100    107    102     97     93     90
    ///   offline, map decoded OK    58     81     98    111    141    179

    ///
    /// The app is FLAT — its shading has come loose from the mesh — and only the sRGB reading
    /// reproduces that. It is not subtle: this project runs in GAMMA colour space
    /// (<c>ProjectSettings m_ActiveColorSpace: 0</c>), and glTFast only works out which textures
    /// are colour and which are data when the project is LINEAR (<c>GltfImport.cs:1674</c>:
    /// <c>if (QualitySettings.activeColorSpace == ColorSpace.Linear)</c>). In gamma the whole
    /// array stays null, <c>forceSampleLinear</c> is false for every texture, KtxUnity therefore
    /// never sets its <c>Linear</c> feature bit, and the transcode target comes out as an sRGB
    /// GPU format. A plain <c>Texture2D</c> would shrug that off — gamma projects do no
    /// conversion — but a KTX2 arrives through <c>Texture2D.CreateExternalTexture</c> wrapping a
    /// texture libktx already uploaded with an sRGB internal format, so the hardware decodes on
    /// every sample no matter what Unity thinks the colour space is.
    ///
    /// The neutral normal 128 is then not 0.5 but <see cref="SrgbToLinear"/>(0.502) = 0.216, and
    /// every texel of a perfectly good tangent-space map tilts <see cref="NeutralTiltDegrees"/> ≈
    /// 53° toward −tangent/−bitangent. Tangent direction follows the UV atlas, so the tilt turns a
    /// different way in every chart — which is exactly why the black arrives as hard-edged
    /// polygons rather than as shading. Where it swings a surface past both lights at once the
    /// forward pass has only ambient left, and Unity's split spherical harmonics (L2 from the
    /// vertex normal, unclamped; L0/L1 from this ruined pixel normal) can sum below zero, which
    /// the frame buffer writes as exactly (0,0,0).
    ///

    /// curled tentacles crosses the terminator every few pixels. Hence 10-12% against 4.6%.
